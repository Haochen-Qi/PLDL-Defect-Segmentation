# PLDL-Defect-Segmentation

Welcome to the demo video for my research paper titled "Progressively Learning Dynamic Level Set for Weakly Supervised Industrial Defect Segmentation." 

In this video, I provide a comprehensive overview of the model's execution and prediction results, offering a visual representation of the methodology proposed in my study.

The primary aim of this demo video is to enhance your understanding of my research approach, particularly in the context of defect segmentation within industrial settings. As part of my commitment to transparency and scientific integrity, I have created this video to provide a more intuitive and in-depth insight into the performance of the proposed model.

Please note that this video serves as a supplement to my research paper, which comprehensively outlines the theoretical foundation, experimental design, and results. Due to confidentiality agreements associated with the collaborative nature of my research, the complete experimental code and dataset are currently not publicly available. However, I believe that this demo video will effectively convey the essence of my methodology and contribute to the broader scientific community's understanding.

Thank you for your interest in my research. I hope this video is helpful to you!
